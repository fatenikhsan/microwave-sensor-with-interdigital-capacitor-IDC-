# Microwave-Sensor-with-Interdigital-Capacitor(IDC)
* This is the improvement of h-field sensing area from previous sensor design(which using capacitor)
* Objective 1) To enlarge the h-field sensing area
* Why IDC?
  - This is because provides higher effective capacitance as compared to the simple parallel plate of the capacitor
